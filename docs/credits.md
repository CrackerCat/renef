# Credits

- **Lua 5.4** - Scripting engine
- **Capstone** - Disassembly and hooking engine
- **Android NDK** - Cross-compilation toolchain

## Inspiration & Special Thanks

Renef was inspired by and built upon the ideas and methodologies of:

- **[Frida](https://frida.re/)** - The dynamic instrumentation toolkit that pioneered scriptable runtime manipulation. Renef's Lua API design and hooking philosophy draw heavily from Frida's elegant approach to dynamic analysis.

- **[Radare2](https://rada.re/)** - The reverse engineering framework that demonstrated the power of modular, scriptable analysis tools. Renef's command structure and memory operations were influenced by radare2's design principles.

- **[TempleOS](https://templeos.org/)** - Terry Davis wrote an OS from scratch including compiler, kernel, and graphics — alone. We're just hooking some Android functions. Respect and R.I.P.

We are grateful to these projects and their communities for paving the way and inspiring this work.
